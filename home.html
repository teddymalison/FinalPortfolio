			<div id="AboutInfo">
			<p>I am a Senior Communications major with a minor in Journalism at Saint Joseph's University. Formerly a full time figure skater, I am finding my way in the wonderful world of communications, having completed a summer internship at <b>QVC television studios</b> and most recently finished an internship at <b>Main Line Today Magazine</b>. I decided to end my full time career as an athlete in pursuit of something I felt was left unfulfilled and pushed to the side for quite some time: my writing potential. The choice was anything but easy- five Olympic rings, or five classes. But to this day, I don't (always) look back.</p>
			<p>You'll often find me wearing the wonderous patterns of Lilly Pulitzer, hiding behind a pair of cateye sunglasses (not really hiding) with a large cup of coffee in one hand and an even larger bag in the other. Or sometimes you'll find me juggling a green smoothie alongside of the coffee and oversized bag. I am a goal-driven, aspiring magazine writer hoping to have a column to call my own. I may be dreaming big- but I'd say that's better than not dreaming at all. </p>
